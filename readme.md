## Goals
- Review importing data from a csv and via mySQL.
- Import data from our local clipboard, a google sheets document, and from an MS Excel file.
- Select one source to use as we continue through the rest of this module.
- Prepare, tidy, and clean the data so that it is ready for exploration and analysis.

- Understand a baseline model, confustion matrix, and evaluation metrics
- Understand how to use various model
